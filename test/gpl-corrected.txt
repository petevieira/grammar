GNU General Public License Third edition of the June 29 , 2007 

 Copyright ( 1 ) 2007 Free Software Foundation , Inc. ( http : //fsf.org ) Allow anyone to copy and distribute this license document full version But it is not allowed to make any modifications 

 Introduction 

 GNU General Public License is a free for software and other kinds of works , the public authority . 

 Most software licenses affirm is designed to deprive you share and modify the software free . In contrast , the GNU General Public License for trying to protect you share freely and change free software - to assure that the software is free for all its users . We , the Free Software Foundation , as the GNU General Public License for most of our software ; This authorization applies equally to any of the software in this way . You can also let your software to be the authorization . `` When we speak of free software , we are referring to freedom of behavior , rather than free prices . GNU General Public License is designed to make sure that you have released a copy of the free software ( and charge for , if you wish ) , free , to ensure that you receive source code or can get the source code you need to assure that you can change the software or part of it in new free software , and that you know you can do these things . 

 To protect your rights , we need to make requirements that forbid anyone to tell you these rights or to ask you to surrender the lights . Therefore , if you post a copy of this software or modify it , you need to take up the responsibility to inspect the freedom of others . 

 For example , if you distribute copies of free software , regardless of the mode free or for a fee , we must you obtained the same freedom given a copy of the recipient . He must make sure that they , too , receive or can get the source code . Are you must show them these terms so they know that they enjoy such rights . `` The developers of the GNU General Public License protect your rights with two steps : ( 1 ) Statement copyright in the software ; ( 2 ) offer you this license document to your copy , distribute and / or modify the software permitted by law . 

 General Public License in order to protect the software developer and author clearly explains that free software is no warranty . Just as users and software of hope , the General Public License software is a modified version must be clearly marked so that their problems will be erroneously attributed to the previous version . 

 Some devices are designed to deny users to install or run a modified version of its internal software , manufacturers can install and put them . This is fundamentally contrary to the purpose of the General Public License protect the user can modify the software free . Appear in most people can not accept personal user product areas such abuse of the authorization system mode . Therefore , we have designed this version of the General Public License prohibits the infringement of the products . In such problems in a large number of other areas , we are ready to extend this provision in future versions of the General Public License , to protect the user 's freedom . 

 Finally , for each program are often threatened by software patents . The government should not allow patents to restrict development and use of general-purpose computer software , but the government does allow this kind of thing in the region , we hope to avoid the patents applied to a free software so that the rest of the software effectively privatized . In order to prevent this from happening , the General Public License ensure that no one is able to be the patents to non-liberalization of free software . `` The following is the detailed terms and conditions of the copy , distribute and modify the software . 

 Terms and Conditions 

 0 Definition 

 `` This License '' refers to the GNU General Public License v3 

 Copyright term also refers to the production of copyright law applicable to other products such as semiconductor shield . The `` The Program '' refers to any works protected by copyright released under this License . Licensee is addressed as `` No '' . `` Authorized person '' and `` copyright recipients '' may be individuals or organizations . The `` Modify '' works from software to copy or to make modifications of all or a wee bit different from the verbatim copying require copyright permission . Modify the outcome of previous works is called a `` modified version '' or `` based on previous works of the state . 

 Coverage program `` means the program has not been modified or program based on the road . `` The program of the `` spread '' refers to the use of the program to do anything if no permission will be direct or indirect infringement under applicable copyright laws , do not run the program on the computer or make shared with people you do not modify . Propagation includes copying , distribution ( with or without modification ) , shared to the public , as well as other acts in some countries . The `` Publish '' a work means any communication behavior of other organizations to make or receive copies . Only through a computer network and a user exchanges , and did not send the program to do the behavior is not released . 

 A display the `` appropriate legal notice '' the interaction of user interface , including a convenience rather significantly the visual components , it has the following features : ( 1 ) displays an appropriate copyright notice ; ( 2 ) tells the use of this program does not provide any warranty ( unless the guarantees explicitly informed ) , the attorney may be released under this License of the Program , as well as a copy if you read the license agreement . In the interface displays a user command or a list of options , such as a menu option in the list need to be consistent with the above specifications . ( 1 . Source code 

 `` Source code '' means to modify the program used in the farm . `` Object code '' refer to any non-source code form of the program . The `` Standard Interface '' has two meanings , the official standard of the First branch defined by the standards organizations ; many specially defined interface for a language , the kind of interface is widely used in such language developers . 

 Executable program `` system library '' does not refer to the entire program , but rather refers to the main components included in the part but does not belong to the past , and only developed in order to enable the components , or in order to achieve some existing open source standard interface . `` Major components '' here refers to a specific operating system to run the program ( if any ) key components ( kernel , window system , and so on ) , or generate the executable program compiler , or in the program object code interpreter . 

 Program in object code corresponding source code means all generated installation ( executable program ) in the object code and source code needed to modify the program , including the control of these behaviors script . However , it does not include system libraries needed by the program , the general-purpose tools , as well as program complete certain functions , without modification , one of those not included in the program generally available free software . For example , information such as frequent interaction of the corresponding source code includes interface definition files associated with the original file of the program , as well as a shared library source code and the programming needs through these subroutines and program section between control flow and other way to obtain the dynamic link subroutine . 

 Corresponding source code does not need to contain any advocacy resources that can regenerate automatically from other parts of these resources . 

 Source code in the form of program source code corresponding to the definition above . ( 2 . Basic license 

 All rights granted under this License Agreement on the terms of the copyright of the program , and provided the stated conditions are met , these licenses can now be recovered . This License explicitly confirm that you can not in the program for any restrictions unmodified version . The authorized coverage run a program to obtain the results only in the results when a coverage program covered by this authorization . This License acknowledges your fair use or copyright law , the right of other similar acts . `` As long as your license is still valid , you can unconditionally production run and spread coverage program that you do not publish . As long as you comply with the terms of the dissemination of information that you do not have the copyright on this authorization , you can convey a covered work to her , to ask them to make special modifications or provide you with the simple device of running these programs . Do you to create or run coverage program as your representatives in your direction and control must do so , to prohibit any program you own the copyright of a copy of their production outside of them and your relationship . `` When the following conditions are met , the release is permitted in any other case . Sublicensing is not allowed , as it becomes necessary . ( 3 . Legitimate right to protect the user against anti-crack law violated 

 Under similar laws of one of the tasks described in Chapter 11 of 1996 by the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty law , or prohibit or restrict the cracking method , cover the program will not be identified as an effective technical means part of . `` When you convey a covered work , you will have to give up any of the prohibitions of the technical means to crack force of the law , even in the implementation of the right to complete the crack under the terms of the authorization on the coverage of the program . Meanwhile , you have any user action or modify the coverage program to perform your legitimate right to attempt to prohibit the technical means to crack . ( 4 . Post a complete copy of 

 The complete copy through any media , you can publish the source code of the program has not been modified , as long as your significant appropriately released on each copy an appropriate copyright notice ; maintain complete all stating that this License and any added to the terms of the non-licensed ; remain intact Disclaimer ; over the program to all recipients a copy of this authorization . `` You can be charged for your copy of the cost of any price or free , you can also provide technical support or liability guarantee fee . 

 5 . Not a modified version of the source code 

 You can in source form in the first four under the terms of a software based on the Program , or from the production of the software needed to modify the program , as long as you meet all of the following conditions : 

 * A ) the production of software must be included prominent notices stating that you modified it , and giving a relevant date . 

 * B ) produced by the software must contain a clear notice , statement , it pointed released under this License and any conditions added 7 . This requirement modifies the requirements of section 4 to `` keep intact all notices '' . 

 * C ) You must license the entire work , as a whole , or any person to obtain a copy of authorization in accordance with the license agreement . This License will therefore any added terms in accordance with section 7 of the whole and all its parts , regardless of how they are packaged , in the form of war . The license does not allow any other form of authorization the software , as if you have separately received such permission , the authorization does not negate the license . 

 * D ) If you make the package containing the interactive user interface , each user interface must display Appropriate Legal Notices ; However , in the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices , your software is not necessary to modify the make them do so . `` A cover of the Commonwealth of the program and the other is not itself the program 's expansion program , the joint was not intended to generate a larger program in a storage or distribution medium , and the Commonwealth of the program and consequential Copyright useless program to limit use or limit the legal rights of the users of the single program given the joint program , the consortium is called an `` aggregate '' . Inclusion of a covered work is an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate . 

 6 . Not a copy of the non-source form of 

 You can distribute the Program in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5 , as long as you look at a way corresponding machine-readable source code is released under the terms of this License : 

 * A ) in the physical product ( including a physical distribution medium ) , or as a part of the object code , and release the corresponding source code in a durable physical medium used for software interchange . 

 * B ) physical product ( including a physical distribution medium ) , or as part of the object code , together with the validity of at least 3 years and a long time and provide spare parts or customer support for that product model , a written undertaking given to each person who possesses the object code of ( 1 ) either in a durable physical medium used for software interchange , not higher than the price it was to perform this source the release behavior of a reasonable fee , a copy of the product copy of the corresponding source code for all software covered by the authorization ; ( 2 ) free of charge either through the network server to provide access to the corresponding source code . 

 * C ) publish a cup of the object code alone , together with a written commitment to provide the corresponding source code . This behavior is allowed only occasionally and not profitable when you received the object code with the commitment to the provisions of the Section 6 ( 1 ) . 

 * D ) at a designated place ( gratis or for a charge ) , providing access to the object code released and not increase the price of the corresponding source code in the same place in the same access . You need not require recipients to do the object code when a copy of the corresponding source code . In the place to copy the object code is a network server , the corresponding source code in another server supports equivalent copying ( by you or a third party ) , as long as you clearly pointed out that next to the object code Where can I find the corresponding source code . No matter what server provides the corresponding source code , you have an obligation to ensure that it is available in any demand to see the requirements of this section . 

 * E ) distribute the object code using peer-to-peer transfer , you need to inform the other nodes in the object code and source code where provided free of charge of the public in accordance with the terms of d 6 . 

 Separable portion of the object code , whose source code as a system library is not included in the corresponding source code , is not need to include in the object code of behavior . The `` User Product '' means ( 1 ) a `` consumer '' , which is usually used for personal , family or day-to-day purposes , tangible personal property ; , or ( 2 ) any design or sales for the company was sold to the personal stuff . In determining whether a product is a consumer product , doubtful cases shall be conducive to the coverage of the results to be used . A particular product received by a particular user , `` normally used '' refers to a typical or common use of such products , regardless of the special circumstances of the user , or the user is the actual use of the product , or how to be the product requirements . Whether a product is on consumer goods , and whether the product has substantial commercial , industrial or non-consumer uses , unless such uses is the only significant mode of one of such products . 

 User Product `` Installation Information '' refers to a modified version of the covered work from the corresponding source code modified version of install and in the user need any method , process , authorization keys , or other information . The information must be sufficient to ensure that the modified object code is not just because modification has been able to continue running . `` If you are under the provisions of this section in the user product , or with , or specifically for use , distribute the object code program in the publishing process user ownership and use rights are permanent or fixed term ( regardless The characteristics of the released ) and transferred to the recipient , the corresponding source code released under the terms described in this section must contain the installation information . But if you or any third-party organization did not retain the ability to install modified object code on the User Product ( for example , the problem is installed in the ROM ) , this requirement will not take effect . 

 Provide installation information and did not ask for the recipient to modify or install the program , or modify or install the program user products continue to provide support service , warranty or upgrade . Network access can be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network , as in violation of the rules and agreements of the network communication . 

 Common file format issued by this section , the corresponding source code , and provide installation information must be released ( and attach one of the time of document to achieve method in source code form to the public shared ) , decompress , reading or copying this information can not require any password . 

 7 . Additional Terms 

 `` Additional permissions '' to supplement a special case by allowing some of the License , the terms of this License . As long as they are valid under applicable law , the entire program into effect additional license should be considered in the contents of this authorization . If additional permissions apply only to part of the program take effect , when the part can separately under those permissions , but the entire program is under the management of the authorization , regardless of the additional permissions . 

 When you post a copy of a covered , you can choose to delete the cost of all or part of any additional license . `` When you modify the program , additional license may require their own removal in certain cases ) . You can place additional permissions on material , and to that you have or can give appropriate copyright permission coverage program . `` The authorized elsewhere provided for you to join in the program material , you can ( if you are authorized by the copyright holder of the material ) with the following terms and conditions supplement the authorization : 

 a. refuse warranties or limitation of liability sections 15 and 16 the terms of the authorization ; or 

 b. require preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or the material contained in the author of the program in the appropriate legal notices contribution ; 

 c. prohibits misrepresentation of the material source , or a modified version of the material marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version version ; or 

 d. restrict the name of the author or licensor of the material used for publicity purposes ; 

 e reduce the level of authorization under trademark law for use of some trade names , trademarks or service marks ; or 

 f. publish the material ( or modified versions ) with the responsibility of the recipient to assume the contract authorization , and material of protection to avoid any such assumptions contract is a direct result of the authorized and the responsibility of the author . `` All other non-permissive additional terms are considered to be 10 `` further restrictions '' . If you receive the program or its parts , claims to be authorized by the management , and a further restriction , you may remove that . In a license document contains a further restriction but allows relicensing or released under this License , this further constraints can not be preserved in such relicensing or release , you can file the terms of the management of the authorization in the coverage program under the material . `` If you add terms to a covered work pursuant to this section , you must join the statement of the additional terms that apply to those files in the source file , or specify where notice of these terms can be found . 

 Additional terms and conditions , whether licensed or non-licensed terms , can be written on a separately written license , or stated as exceptions ; Both of these methods can achieve the above requirements . 

 8 . Termination of authorization 

 Expressly authorized in this License , not only have to propagate or modify any covered work . In other dissemination or modify a covered program attempts are illegal , and will automatically terminate your rights under this License ( including any patent granted according to 11 of the third paragraph of the terms authorized ) . 

 However , if you cease all violation of this License , then your license from a particular copyright holder is obtained in the following manner to restore ( 1 ) You can temporarily authorized to have , to terminate your license until the copyright holder explicitly ; ( b ) If , within 60 days after you stop the violation of this License , the copyright holder is not in some reasonable way to inform your breach , then you can permanently get the authorization . 

 Further , in a copyright holder in some reasonable way to inform your acts of violation of this License , which is the first time you receive a notice of violation of the authorization from the copyright holder ( of any software ) , and within 30 days of receipt of the notification amendment violation , then you will get the authorization from the copyright holder permanently restore . 

 Organizations to obtain authorization from you when your license is terminated under the provisions of this section , as long as they do not violate the license agreement , and its mandate will not be terminated . Rights have been restored , not only have to qualify under the terms of the 10 new authorized access to the material . 

 9 . Get a copy does not need to accept this License 

 You do not have to accept this License Agreement in order to receive or run a copy of the program . Just because of the peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy propagation behavior , is not require acceptance of this License Agreement . However , in addition to the authority of any licensing agreements are not granted permission you propagate or modify any covered work . Therefore , if you are modifying or propagating a copy of this program , when you default to accept this License . 

 10 . Downstream recipient automatically authorize 

 Each time you convey a covered work on the recipient automatically receives a license from the original authorized in accordance with the license agreement to run , modify and propagate the authorization of the program . Pursuant to this authorization , you are not responsible for the implementation of any third-party organization . The `` Entity transaction '' refers to the transfer of the control of an organization , or substantially all assets , or subdividing an organization , or merging organizations affairs . If propagation of a covered entity transaction , each organization receiving a copy of the program in the transaction will get a copy of its predecessor has authorized or able to be provided under the terms of the previous corresponding work from the predecessor program the rights of the source code , in the predecessor has reasonable efforts to obtain the source code . `` You may not impose any constraints on the implementation of the rights from the license agreement to obtain or confirm . For example , you may not impose a license fee , royalty , or other charge any fees for the implementation of the rights granted under this License . You may not initiate litigation ( including a joint lawsuit and counterclaim ) claimed that by making , using , yelling , wholesale or importing the Program or any part thereof infringes any patent . 

 11 . Patent 

 `` Contributor '' is a copyright holder of the program of the program based on the program use rights granted under this License . This program is to become a contributor 's `` contributor version '' . `` A contributor 's `` essential patent affirms the contributor 's share of all patents and control , whether already acquired or obtained in the future , that may be some way infringe the parent . The authorization allows the production , use and sale of its contributor version , it does not include only further modification of the contributor version violated patents affirmed . For this purpose , `` control '' includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this authorization . 

 Each contributor patent license under the contributor grants you a non-exclusive , worldwide , without royalty patent license allows you to create , use , sale , wholesale , import and otherwise run , modify and propagate its contribution those versions of context . `` In the following three paragraphs , a `` patent license '' is any express agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent ( such as the use of patented oral permission or a contract not to sue for patent infringement ) . To an organization to grant a patent license to make this not in the organization proposed to enforce patent rights commitments . 

 If you clearly know a release authorization based on a patent covering the program , the corresponding source code of the program and can not , and the terms of this License by the network server or other effective way to the public free of charge to provide access , you must be : ( 1 ) to access the corresponding source code in accordance with the above method ; , or ( 2 ) abandon authorized to get any benefit from the program 's patent ; , or ( 3 ) the patent somehow consistent with the requirements of this License authorization extends to downstream recipients . One or more of the `` in case they clearly know '' means you know that in a country for the patent license , your conveying the covered behavior or recipient to cover the program 's behavior , due to the authorization of the patent infringement patent rights recognized in this country , and these patents you have sufficient reason to believe that they are valid . 

 , Pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement , if you get the version of the publication or dissemination of a program transmission , and to give some organizations receiving the covered work , patent licensing , allows them to use , dissemination , modify , one of the covered special version , then the patent license you grant these organizations will be automatically extended to the recipient of all the covered work and works based on the program . 

 A patent license is `` biased '' , if it is not included within the scope of its coverage , prohibits the exercise of , for the requirements do not perform explicitly recognized under the authority of one or more of the lights . If you can not convey a covered work : If your software distribution industry of third-party organizations Agreement , the Agreement requires that you pay to the organization , according to the release of the program while the organization is given in your agreement any organization to receive the covered work from you , a discriminatory patent license , either ( 1 ) , together with a copy of your release ( or copies made from those copies ) ; either ( b ) primarily for and together with a products or contain the covered work , the Commonwealth . If you sign the agreement or the rate of the patent license earlier than March 28 , 2007 , then you are not subject to the terms of . 

 Any part of this authorization will not be construed to deny or limit any implied license or other measures to protect your patent inviolable under applicable patent law . 

 12 . Do not give up the freedom of others 

 If you 're experiencing with the authorization to the paradoxical situation ( both court decisions , contracts , or other circumstances ) , they can now be removed from the requirements of this License . If you can not in the same time in accordance with the authorization of the obligations and other obligations of a covered work , then you will not be able to publish them . For example , if you are accepted to this program may receive from you the terms of the royalty-free , the only way you could satisfy both the authorization and those terms do not publish the program . 

 13 . Used with the GNU Affero General Public License 

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement , you have the right to link any coverage program and the program based on the third edition of the GNU Affero General Public License , and publish the joint program . The terms of this authorization remains effective for your coverage program , but the GNU Affero General Public License section 13 , concerning interaction through a network request be interested in the entire Commonwealth . 

 14 . The revision of the authorized 

 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised version of the GNU General Public License and Af or new versions . Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version , it may differ in detail to address new problems and situations . 

 Each version is in a distinguishing version number . In the Program specifies that a particular applied to the program of the GNU General Public License version number `` any later version '' , you have the right to choose the terms and conditions of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation . In the program does not specify the specific terms of the GNU General Public License version number , you can select any of the Free Software Foundation has released version . `` If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide the future of the GNU General Public License can be used in the program , then the agent to accept any version of the public referred to above are applied to the program permanently authorizes you to choose the version . 

 Later license versions may give you additional or different license . However , you choice of subsequent versions will not impose any obligations on any author or copyright holder . 

 15 . Disclaimer 

 Permitted by applicable law , this authorization does not the program undertake any guarantee responsibility . Unless a written statement , therefore , the copyright holder and / or third-party organization of this program , `` business as usual '' does not assume the responsibility of warranty of any kind , either promised or implied , including , but not limited to , implied warranties of merchantability and as a a special PURPOSE default warranties . Near the entire risk of the quality and performance of the program . SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE , you should bear all the necessary services , the cost of repair or correction . 

 16 . Limitation of Liability

 17 . Interpretation of sections 15 and 16 

 If the disclaimer of warranty and the shape of responsibility can not be given legal effect in accordance with local laws and terms , reviewing courts shall apply the closest to completely give up the law on the civil liability of the program , unless accompanied guarantees or obligations of the responsibility of the program assumes that the contract fees . 

 - The terms and conditions of the end - 

 How to apply these provisions in the new program . `` If you develop a new program , and you want it as much as possible to the general public , the best way to achieve this purpose is to make it free software . And in accordance with these terms and conditions of the software re-released and modify . `` To do this , attach the following notices to the program . The safest approach to the statement placed at the beginning of each source file to most effectively convey the message unsecured obligations ; and each file should have at least the `` copyright '' column , and this statement where the full prompt . 

 < One line to give the program 's name and a brief Copyright ( 1 ) < year > < name > 

 This program is free software ; based on the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation , the program re-released and / or modify ; Whether you are based on the third edition of the License , or ( at your option ) any issued after 1 version . `` This program is based on the use of the purpose to be released , but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY ; nor the implied warranty as to the implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose .
